1. Use subagents to read the Codex SDK documentation (e.g., https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/sdk/typescript) to understand its features, usage patterns, and API details.
2. Check if a skill already exists in the `.sauna/skills` directory. If it does, review the existing skill implementation for accuracy and completeness against the SDK documentation.
3. If the skill does not exist, create a new skill file in `.sauna/skills` following the recommended format for skills.
