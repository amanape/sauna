Let's identify what is the job to be done (JTBD).

Study the referenced file above to understand the current problem space.

Ask me questions to clarify the JTBD and expected results.

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask questions and gather information.

Use up to 10 parallel subagents to study the existing source code.

Assume not implemented, search before asking questions.

Do NOT make any code changes.

1. Break each JTBD into properly-scoped topics of concern
2. Write one spec file per topic with testable acceptance criteria
3. IMPORTANT: If a topic needs "and" to describe it, split it into multiple topics.

After you have gathered enough information, create the specs in `ralph/specs/[topic-name].md`.
